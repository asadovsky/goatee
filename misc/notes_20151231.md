This document contains rough notes from design explorations for p2p
collaborative editing.

# Client

- JS widgets for counter, register, set, etc.
- WebSocket protocol: client connects to server, sends object ID to initialize
  the stream; from then on, client sends and receives type-specific ops
- Client messages specify base op id; server messages specify op id
- Client either disallows or buffers ops not parented off server state
- Key question for real-time text editing: is unidirectional data flow fast
  enough? With current Vanadium RPC performance, the answer is probably "no".
  And if the answer is "no", we need client-side OT or CRDT.

### Undo/redo, assuming unidirectional data flow

- Server messages specify opId
- Client can do undoId := undo(opId) and redo(undoId)
- Client lib hides the undo/redo stack

# Server

- Probably want a hybrid of state-based and op-based, where we transmit
  per-object deltas (relative to some genvector) on the wire but maintain a
  notion of "current state" at each node

### State-based

- Store, and every object inside of it, has an associated genvector
- Initiator sends its current genvector; responder sends current state for all
  out-of-date objects
- Note, this is at odds with local client-server OT, since we won't know how to
  transform the client ops (unless we retain state history at the server and can
  compute a patch between any two states)
- Alternatively, we could implement client libs that speak CRDT (i.e. subset of
  sync protocol) with local server, but that seems heavy-weight
- Note, today's Syncbase objects can be thought of as state-based LWW registers,
  though for that our DAG bookkeeping is superfluous

### Op-based

- More like Syncbase: oplog with keys of the form [devId]:[gen], where the value
  contains the object id, the position within the local oplog, and some
  representation of the object value delta (possibly a snapshot)
- Maintain some representation of "current object state", or state as of some
  recent oplog position, for fast state materialization
- May not need to maintain a DAG; it depends on how exactly conflicts get
  resolved
- Seems better for supporting undo-redo (?)
